ASTRA-Net: The End-to-End IoT Ecosystem for the Amazon

Welcome, Global Evaluators! Navigate our project like a guided tour.

**1. The Problem: The Amazon's Logistics Blackout**
Imagine vital rivers as highways, but without GPS, communication, or safety monitoring. Thatâ€™s the Amazon. Our project directly addresses the "Commercializing Low-Earth Orbit" challenge by targeting this massive, underserved market with a viable, scalable, and high-impact business model. This isn't just a hackathon project; it's YAKAMI TECH's founding mission.

**2. Our Solution: ASTRA-Net Ecosystem (How it Works)**
We developed a comprehensive IoT communication and monitoring ecosystem. Our system is built on three core components forming a digital mesh network over the rivers:
-   **Yakami Explorer:** Low-cost, rugged, low-power IoT tracking devices for vessels.
-   **Yakami Eco Station GateWay:** Solar-powered, autonomous gateways collecting data from Explorer devices and relaying via satellite backhaul to our cloud platform. They also gather vital environmental data.
-   **CARATAI-I:** Our proposed 3U nanosatellite, designed to provide the essential satellite link for 100% coverage.
For this challenge, we developed a functional cloud backend (FastAPI) and a frontend dashboard displaying simulated real-time vessel tracking and data on an interactive map.

**3. Benefits & Intended Impact (Triple Impact Model)**
Our solution generates a crucial triple impact:
-   **Economic:** Unprecedented operational efficiency, fleet management, and cargo security for logistics companies, leading to significant cost savings.
-   **Social:** Enhanced safety and peace of mind for passengers and families, with real-time tracking and alerts.
-   **Environmental (ESG):** A vital environmental monitoring network collecting data on water levels, weather, and more, supporting scientific research and Civil Defense.
Our impact is to create the digital infrastructure backbone for the Amazon's sustainable future, fostering growth, drastically improving safety, and enabling data-driven conservation. Our model is scalable to other major river basins globally.

**4. Technology & Tools Used**
-   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
-   **Cloud & Deployment:** Google Cloud Run, AWS
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps API
-   **Hardware Design:** Autodesk Fusion 360
-   **Data Sources:** NASA ODPO, DAS (NASA), Copernicus Sentinel Hub (ESA)
-   **Project Management & Collaboration:** GitHub, Miro, Notion

**5. Our Creative Approach & Why We Stand Out**
Our creativity lies in the unique application of existing technology to solve a non-obvious, critical problem:
-   **Market Innovation:** Commercializing LEO for the Amazonian riverine logistics' 'blue ocean'.
-   **Business Model Innovation:** Our ESG-centric model means social and environmental impact *is* the business.
-   **Technical Innovation:** Hybrid LoRaWAN + Satellite architecture for cost-effective, energy-efficient Amazonian solutions.
Our design was guided by Amazonian realities: cost-effectiveness, solar energy autonomy, rugged durability, and user-friendliness for non-technical users. We used NASA's DAS for responsible orbital design.
